# Steam Games Analysis
This was my final project for the Data Mining course at the Missouri University of Science &amp; Technology

The goal of this project was to analyze a dataset using a K-Nearest Neighbors. I chose to analyze the Steam Games dataset from Kaggle. The goal I set for myself was to take
input as a game that the user enjoys, and return a list of recommendations of games that the user would also like. A secondary goal of the project was to use K-Means Clustering to
do the same task, and to compare how the two differed. I was unfortunately unable to deliver the secondary goal by the time the project was due.
